      For environmental and public health activists, The Progressive Era, which
      spanned about 1890 to 1920, saw a surge in reform attempts in the United
      States. For a variety of causes, a large number of people took part in a
      wide range of changes, including women's suffrage, political reform, and
      prohibition. Progressive reformers pushed for these reforms in response to
      the growing rate of urbanization and industrialization in
      late-nineteenth-century America, as well as the issues that came with it.
      Industry flourished immensely as a result of new technological
      breakthroughs in transportation, communication, and organization, and
      immigrants flocked into unprepared cities in search of new jobs. Numerous
      issues arose as a result of the lack of government monitoring and
      regulations: housing became overcrowded, dilapidated, and disease-ridden;
      industries failed to safeguard their employees financially, physically, or
      health-wise; and pollution grew common.
    </p>
  
    <p class="progessive">
      The Progressive Movement was a high-water mark for environmental and
      public health reformers. The movement starts with the end of the American
      frontier and questions about increasing impacts of urbanization. Reform
      was the common concern – reform of working conditions, slum housing, food
      adulteration, sanitation, drinking water, polluting industries, hunting
      laws and mining practices. President Teddy Roosevelt and Sierra Club
      founder John Muir represent the two major approaches to environmentalism
      in this period. Roosevelt advocates a “wise use” of natural resources and
      an approach that takes the future into account while accommodating some
      present needs. Muir opposes the “wise use” idea and fights for outright
      preservation of unspoiled wilderness.

      Since 1872 the United States National Park System has grown from a single,
      public reservation called Yellowstone National Park to include 430
      natural, historical, recreational, and cultural areas throughout the
      United States, its territories, and island possessions. On August 25,
      1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed the "Organic Act" creating the
      National Park Service, a federal bureau in the Department of the Interior
      responsible for maintaining national parks and monuments that were then
      managed by the department. The National Park System has since expanded to
      423 units (often referred to as parks), more than 150 related areas, and
      numerous programs that assist in conserving the nation's natural and
      cultural heritage for the benefit of current and future generations.

    <p class="johnmuir">
      John Muir, also known as "John of the Mountains" and "Father of the
      National Parks", was an influential Scottish-American naturalist, author,
      environmental philosopher, botanist, zoologist, glaciologist, and early
      advocate for the preservation of wilderness in the United States of
      America. Muir’s writings convinced the U.S. government to protect
      Yosemite, Sequoia, Grand Canyon and Mt. Rainier as national parks. John
      wrote and had published over 300 magazine articles and 12 books. These
      books and articles bubble over with his love of adventure, nature,
      wildness and the inter-connectivity of it all. At the time of his death he
      was working on a book about his travels in Alaska. He had plans and enough
      material in his notebooks for ten more books.

    <p class="antiquities">
      The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorizes the President to proclaim national
      monuments on federal lands that contain historic landmarks, historic and
      prehistoric structures, or other objects of historic or scientific
      interest.

        Why is this movement the most important problem facing our nation?
      </h4>
      <ul class="answ1">
        <li>
          As the progression era develops, the lack of environmental
          consciousness confronts society. We work to preserve land as
          undeveloped wilderness for aesthetic reasons, or to preserve resources
          such as forests for future human use.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="quest2">What are your recommendations to fix the problem?</h4>
      <ul class="answ2">
        <li>
          Find cleaner and more environmental solutions, preserve the
          environment, ect. Conserving the nation's resources, eliminating
          inefficient raw material usage, and reclaiming vast swaths of unused
          territory.

        Who are the key people/books/etc that influence others to join/support
        your movement, and why are they so important?

        <li>
          Roosevelt used his authority to create 150 national forests, 51
          federal wildlife sanctuaries, 4 national animal sanctuaries, 5
          national parks, and 18 national monuments on over 230 million acres of
          public land. Was established.

        What have you done as a movement to make this country a better place?
      </h4>
      <ul class="answ4">
        <li>
          We have constructed the 1916 congressional bill in order to establish
          the National Park service, created by our very own Woodrow Wilson to
          protect 35 national parks and monuments to be protected and managed by
          said department.

        <li>
          John Muir focused his conservation efforts on the establishment of
          more national parks by the United States government. There was only
          one national park in 1890: Yellowstone. Muir, on the other hand,
          desired the Yosemite region's state park to be turned into a national
          park.

        <li>
          Gifford Pinchot tripled the nation's forest reserves as the first
          chief of the US Forest Service, ensuring their long-term health for
          conservation and recreational purposes.

        <li>
          Others concerned about environmental issues, on the other hand,
          advocated for solutions to be found within cities rather than outside
          of them. New, more cost-effective strategies for even more difficult
          pollution problems.
