      For environmental and public health activists, The Progressive Era, which
      spanned about 1890 to 1920, saw a surge in reform attempts in the United
      States. For a variety of causes, a large number of people took part in a
      wide range of changes, including women's suffrage, political reform, and
      prohibition. Progressive reformers pushed for these reforms in response to
      the growing rate of urbanization and industrialization in
      late-nineteenth-century America, as well as the issues that came with it.
      Industry flourished immensely as a result of new technological
      breakthroughs in transportation, communication, and organization, and
      immigrants flocked into unprepared cities in search of new jobs. Numerous
      issues arose as a result of the lack of government monitoring and
      regulations: housing became overcrowded, dilapidated, and disease-ridden;
      industries failed to safeguard their employees financially, physically, or
      health-wise; and pollution grew common.

    <p class="progessive">
      The Progressive Movement was a high-water mark for environmental and
      public health reformers. The movement starts with the end of the American
      frontier and questions about increasing impacts of urbanization. Reform
      was the common concern – reform of working conditions, slum housing, food
      adulteration, sanitation, drinking water, polluting industries, hunting
      laws and mining practices. President Teddy Roosevelt and Sierra Club
      founder John Muir represent the two major approaches to environmentalism
      in this period. Roosevelt advocates a “wise use” of natural resources and
      an approach that takes the future into account while accommodating some
      present needs. Muir opposes the “wise use” idea and fights for outright
      preservation of unspoiled wilderness.

    <p class="johnmuir">
      John Muir, also known as "John of the Mountains" and "Father of the
      National Parks", was an influential Scottish-American naturalist, author,
      environmental philosopher, botanist, zoologist, glaciologist, and early
      advocate for the preservation of wilderness in the United States of
      America. Muir’s writings convinced the U.S. government to protect
      Yosemite, Sequoia, Grand Canyon and Mt. Rainier as national parks. John
      wrote and had published over 300 magazine articles and 12 books. These
      books and articles bubble over with his love of adventure, nature,
      wildness and the inter-connectivity of it all. At the time of his death he
      was working on a book about his travels in Alaska. He had plans and enough
      material in his notebooks for ten more books.

      Since 1872 the United States National Park System has grown from a single,
      public reservation called Yellowstone National Park to include 430
      natural, historical, recreational, and cultural areas throughout the
      United States, its territories, and island possessions. On August 25,
      1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed the "Organic Act" creating the
      National Park Service, a federal bureau in the Department of the Interior
      responsible for maintaining national parks and monuments that were then
      managed by the department. The National Park System has since expanded to
      423 units (often referred to as parks), more than 150 related areas, and
      numerous programs that assist in conserving the nation's natural and
      cultural heritage for the benefit of current and future generations.

    <p class="antiquities">
      The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorizes the President to proclaim national
      monuments on federal lands that contain historic landmarks, historic and
      prehistoric structures, or other objects of historic or scientific
      interest.
