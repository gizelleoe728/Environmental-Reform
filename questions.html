      <ul class="answ1">
        <li>
          As the progression era develops, the lack of environmental
          consciousness confronts society. We work to preserve land as
          undeveloped wilderness for aesthetic reasons, or to preserve resources
          such as forests for future human use.

      </ul>
      <h4 class="quest2">What are your recommendations to fix the problem?</h4>
      <ul class="answ2">

          Find cleaner and more environmental solutions, preserve the
          environment, ect. Conserving the nation's resources, eliminating
          inefficient raw material usage, and reclaiming vast swaths of unused
          territory.

      </h4>

          We have constructed the 1916 congressional bill in order to establish
          the National Park service, created by our very own Woodrow Wilson to
          protect 35 national parks and monuments to be protected and managed by
          said department.

          John Muir focused his conservation efforts on the establishment of
          more national parks by the United States government. There was only
          one national park in 1890: Yellowstone. Muir, on the other hand,
          desired the Yosemite region's state park to be turned into a national
          park.

          Gifford Pinchot tripled the nation's forest reserves as the first
          chief of the US Forest Service, ensuring their long-term health for
          conservation and recreational purposes.

        <li>
          Others concerned about environmental issues, on the other hand,
          advocated for solutions to be found within cities rather than outside
          of them. New, more cost-effective strategies for even more difficult
          pollution problems.
